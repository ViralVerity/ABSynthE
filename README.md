Agent-based simulator for Ebola Virus

## Simulation scripts

Contains scripts for running various different versions of the simulator.

Computer model and server model are functionally the same, but have different file pathways depending on whether they are being run locally or on the server.

No caps model - no caps on days or case numbers

### Above are to be consolidated, so that a command line option will tell it whether to run with caps or not

Non-stoch model - to generate the same trees each time for testing other hypotheses

Tree_simulator - generates the coalescent tree and corresponding skyline stochastically 
Tree simulator nonstoch - the same but non-stochastically

## Results scripts

Notebooks for analysing results and producing figures from simulation runs
